# socket.io-chat-application
School assignment to build a chat application with socket.io and creating commands.

## Goal
In this project the goal is to use socket.io to create a chat application and with the help of a third part system use an API to have another optional function in this application. This option/command also should be seen when the “/” sign is written in the input field. I planned to complete the minimum but I left room for improvement in my assignment .  

With this program the users are able to communicate with each other but the messages will be seen for every users except the sender. The colors of the speech bubbles show if the message is from the user itself or from the other users.

There is also an added function that the users are able to send emojis in their messages. It can be used by clicking on the emoji icon or type “/” to the input area and then chose “emojis” from the commands. 

There are also other commands but they are not implemented in this project. I just let them in the choices to show that it is possible to add new features to the program easily. 


### Room for improvement
*	There could be different users with their own login datas.
*	When a user is typing it could be seen by the other users.
*	It could be possible to choose only one person or create different separate groups to send messages only for them.
*	There could be much more command actions such as a search function or adding gifs to the message.
*	There could be notifications as a new message appears.
*	The style of the application could also be more accurate, just an example that the messages could automatically scroll down to the bottom.
